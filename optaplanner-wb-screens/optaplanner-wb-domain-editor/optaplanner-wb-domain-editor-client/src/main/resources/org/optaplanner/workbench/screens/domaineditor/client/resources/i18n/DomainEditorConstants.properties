PlannerCheckTranslator.MultiplePlanningSolutionsToBeCreated=The operation will result in multiple Planning Solution instances within a single project.
PlannerCheckTranslator.ScoreHolderGlobalToBeDeleted=The operation will result in scoreHolder global variable associated with this Planning Solution being deleted. This will cause build errors if the global is referenced in rules.
PlannerCheckTranslator.ScoreHolderGlobalToBeChanged=The operation will result in scoreHolder global variable associated with this Planning Solution changing its type. This will cause build errors if the global is referenced in rules.
PlannerCheckTranslator.ScoreHolderGlobalTypeNotRecognized=scoreHolder global variable will not be generated, as the selected score type is not supported.
PlannerCheckTranslator.ScoreHolderGlobalFileToBeRemovedMessage=Globals definition has been generated automatically based on a selected score type in a Planning Solution. Deleting the file can result in corruption of rules, which reference scoreHolder variable.
PlannerCheckTranslator.ScoreHolderGlobalToBeDefinedManuallyMessage=Globals definition contains scoreHolder variable, which is intended for OptaPlanner use only. The scoreHolder variable is generated automatically when a Planning Solution is created and no further user action is required. It is recommended to create the Planning Solution first before proceeding to rules definition.
